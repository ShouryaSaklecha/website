            I’m an FPGA Engineer working on neuromorphic systems. These are essentially custom chips for industrial-grade cameras designed to run at high speed and low power (see{" "}

            Earlier, at university, I was lucky to work on some meaningful projects: a geo-imagery satellite, contributions to the world’s fastest solar vehicle (and two other world records), Australia’s first hydrogen/solar/electric car, assistive tech for people with Usher’s syndrome, and a hardware luma-enhancement algorithm. I also published research, received scholarships, and took part in the World Solar Challenge. It was a full and rewarding four years.

            I’m based in Sydney, Australia, and hold a Bachelor’s in Computer Engineering (Honours) from UNSW. Here are areas I’ve built experience in:
            <p>Hardware: VHDL | Xilinx FPGAs | Vivado | Vitis HLS | RTL Design | Digital System Design | Microcontrollers | Verilog | PCB Design | Matlab | Fusion360 CAD</p>
            <p>Software: Python | Java | C++ (20) | JavaScript | HTML | CSS | React | Git</p>
            Others: Engineering Design | Figma | Bubble | UI/UX | Excel | Notion | Research | Formal Systems Engineering

            I read a mix of fiction, non-fiction, and research papers. I’ve played guitar and bass since 2012 and hope to learn piano next. Aviation has always interested me (I can usually identify planes overhead), and I enjoy exploring philosophy and theology. I also like teaching physics and computer science to high-school students and sometimes volunteer my time. In 2025, I plan to write more — one reason I started this site.
